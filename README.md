# Iris-Classification-KNN-Algorithm

K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm, is one of the most popular Supervised Learning Algorithm which is used in the Machine Learning Field. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.Thereâ€™s no need to build a model, tune several parameters, or make additional assumptions. The algorithm is versatile. It can be used for classification, regression, and search.

The KNN Algorithm was implemented on Iris Dataset, to test on how well it can classify and measure its performance.
