# Iris-Classification-KNN-Algorithm

K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm, is one of the most popular Supervised Learning Algorithm which is used in the Machine Learning Field. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.There’s no need to build a model, tune several parameters, or make additional assumptions. The algorithm is versatile. It can be used for classification, regression, and search.

KNN Algorithm was used for the Machine Learning model and was then implemented on Iris Dataset. The aim was to check how well the ML model classified 3 types of Iris flower species based on their Sepal and Petal Lengths and Widths and measured the model’s performance. Python libraries used were NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.
